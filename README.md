### Hi there, I'm Casey McCrimmon aka KCMac89 :wave:

#### I am a software engineer working primarily with flight simulators.

#### I graduated with a B.S. degree in Computer Science from Notheastern State University in May 2022.

#### I have some experience with many programming languages including C++, C#, Python, Java, Javascript, HTML, and SQL. My goal is to expand my experience with these languages to learn all the best practices and nuances and then begin to specialize in those areas I am most interested in.
